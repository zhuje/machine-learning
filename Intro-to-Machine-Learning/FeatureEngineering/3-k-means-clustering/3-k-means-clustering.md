# Clustering with k-means 
- A type of unsupervised learning (no labels, creating bins or discrete clusters of data)
- The "k" in k-means is the number of 'centroids' that are used to determine the number of clusters. 
- A datapoint will get assigned to the closest centroid. This is how the clusters are formed.

- The algorithm for clustering with k-means happens in two parts. First, assign datapoints to the nearest centroid. Second, move the centroid to minimize the distance between its datapoints.
